    The purpose of the SvmValidator class is to train and encapsulate
    a machine learning model used to validate the output of the GaleShapley class.

    The SvmValidator can be used in conjunction with the GaleShapley class 
    to "train" the gale-shapley algorithm into making more informed decisions 
    during the matchmaking process.
