# CS3208 Team Alpha - Skillbridge
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Skillbridge, an automated internship match-making software commissioned to Team Alpha by the university's school of medicine, medical sciences and nutrition. In this document you will find a broad explanation of what the application does and how to run it on your own machine, if you so wish. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID) demostration of the application in action can be found 
### Running the application

- CREATE internships from internship form submission âœ…
- add front-end bootstrap validation to the student and internship forms
- add CI/CD pipeline to repo
- transfer over code for the gale-shapley algorithm
  - define a data-cleaning pipeline
  - define a gale-shapley matcher which requires data-cleaning pipeline to be invoked
  - define ML validator model which requires GS matcher to run
- define the admin panel with all the functionalities listed in the old repo
- transfer over dashboard code and integrate it within the current system
- create journey map for the application, do one for each user in the application!

- extras
    1. in internship.html and internship-details.html, prepopulate the recruiter and company id and disable those fields
    2. implement CRUD operations for internships and interviews

next steps - integrate the work done by everyone else over sprint 4 and 5

- implement authentication (login, signup, login required etc.)
- obtain tests written so far and transfer them over to the appropriate test folder
